the learning mechanism used in this project is linear regression
It looks at a scatter of data points and attempts to find the best fit line
through the data
It's not the best for randomised data but can be good for similar data
this is linear algebra and the equation for it is 'y = mx + c'

It determines the dependant by taking the equation of the line and working out y from that

 If the data it learns from is random then the line
will still be drawn as a best fit line but not a good fit line because it will just draw through the centre
of the data and the dependant prediction will be inaccurate most of the time.
