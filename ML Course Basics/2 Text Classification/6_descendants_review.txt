Disney's Descendants is a miracle of campy film-making. The cheese levels are off the charts as the teenaged children of the Disney villains sing, dance, and fall in love with their heroic counterparts.
The highlights have to be the so bad it's awful rap rendition of "Be Our Guest," the depiction of Maleficent as a tap dancing fiend, and the rest of the villains being depicted as washed up home-bodies who vegetate on the couch all day.
To be fair to the younger actors, they're game with their performances. The script feels like a fan fiction written by middle school age kids with plot holes galore: how did the villains reproduce? I'm guessing they either asexually budded or hooked up with other villains to produce them? Also, if the nerdy Doug is the son of Dopey, then who's his mother? And this is just the icing on the cake: why is Prince Ben okay with Mal slipping him a love potion? How did the wand summon Maleficent when the fairy godmother's kid just wanted to use it to make herself beautiful? Ah, who cares? This is guilty pleasure level fun and I'm sad to say I'll probably watch it again.
