Explanation:

It stands for Support Vector Machines

SVM attempts to create a hyperplane

a hyperplane divides the data with something that is straight -
it is a linear way to divide the data e.g. a line splitting up
two separate clusters of red and green dots

It works out where the line should be by making the line be
the same distance away from one point of each class

As the only requirements for the hyperplane are straight,
same difference away from a point of each class and
no points further in front of the ones chosen, there could
potentially be several lines so which gives the best result:

The best one is the one where the points are furthest apart
the distance between the points is called the margin because
the larger the margin the more the two classes can be separated
e.g. if you had a red dot cluster in the top left and a green
one in the bottom right then a if you had a vertical line
a dot to the left of the line would be red even if it was
in the bottom-slightly-left center which would be nearest
to green, however, a diagonal line, which would be best,
would make dots nearest green be classified as green and
vice versa because of the way the line is positioned

However there are some problems with this:
If it does not look perfect and form separate clusters and
mingles with other datasets it can be almost impossible
to draw a clear cut line through

To fix this kernels are used:
kernel is a functions, it takes inputs and returns an output
in this case it takes X1 and X2 and returns X3
Note:
X1 = x axis
X2 = y axis
X3 = z axis

This gives a third coordinate to each point, it doesn't always
work though

If that doesn't work then a fourth dimension is added

Kernels don't just have to take a plain X1 or X2
you could pass X1^ and X2^ for example and hope that this works

You could also place the hyperplane so that it doesn't
separate all the points on separate sides as long as it
makes a better accuracy level overall, this is called a soft
margin, a hard margin is when there are no other of the
same class of differnt sides of the hyperplane
