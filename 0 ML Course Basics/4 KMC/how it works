KMC stands for K Means Clustering
It is an unsupervised algorithm as in you don't need to
feed the labels for the datapoints when training the model
all you need to do it give it a lot of features which make
up one point, you don't specify which points are which
that's up to the computer to work out

the k stands for how many clusters from 0 - 9, k divided the
graph into sections

Explanation:

It creates k amount of centroids in random positions on the
graph of datapoints
then it divides the points to be part of each centroid
depending on how close they are to the each centroid

next the center of the each point is found and the centroid
is put in the middle of the points that it is closest to
this is done by the math:

Step 1
First Coordinate:
(X1 + X2 + X3)/amount of points
X1 = the x coordinate of a point, this continues to the amount
of points e.g. X1, X2, X3, X4 e.t.c.

Step 2
Second Coordinate:
(P2 X2 + P1 X2 + P3 X2)/ amount of points
P1 X2 = the y coordinate of a point, this continues to the amount
of points e.g. X1, X2, X3, X4 e.t.c.

Step 3
Next we check if points need to be reassigned by:
Drawing a line between the two centroids, finding the middle
of the line and drawing a line at 90 degrees down the center
If any points lie on a different side to their corresponding
centroid then they have to be reassigned to the centroid they
are closest to

Step 1, 2 and 3 are repeated until after the line is drawn
between the middle of the centroids and there is no more
change

Disadvantages:
Speed - you have to determine the distance between every
centroid and every point several times, having up to 700
features is also possible so X1 + X2 all the way up to X700
could take an long time
