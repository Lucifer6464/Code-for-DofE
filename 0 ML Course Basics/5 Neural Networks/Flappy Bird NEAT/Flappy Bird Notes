NEAT stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies

Documentation for NEAT:

Website for an introduction of NEAT including config file documentation:

Very informative essay on how NEAT works and how to use it

When planning think about all the different types of objects you will need:
bird (multiple birds when programming AI)
pipes
floor


What NEAT does is add, remove and adjust weights and neurons. It favours smaller architectures so that your network
does not unnecessarily become too complicated.



What it handles:



Inputs (bird y, top pipe, bottom pipe (although you could try only one pipe but it could take longer to initialise))

Outputs (to jump or not to jump, 1 neuron for the input)

Activation function (we pick the functions for the input and output and NEAT chooses the functions for the hidden
layer(s). We are choosing TanH (hyperbolic tangent) for our input layer

Population size (how many birds we run each generation. The best ones bred and their children and mutated. We keep
on doing this until we get a perfect bird)

Fitness function (how we decide which birds should be selected to be bred. We will choose the ones which got the
furthest. We can influence birds so that they will try to go further as well)

Max generations (it is what it says, its just there so that our program does not unnecessarily keep on running an model
that isn't working well, our limit will be 30)



There is a huge file containing all of the values called config.txt with the probability of mutation and everything else
All the types of variables explanation is in the documentation
