Bag of Words Explanation:

We currently have a string of words that contains all of our tags and patterns. However, neural networks need numbers
to deal with so we have to produce some numbers for the network to deal with

We will create a list that will be the length of all of the different patterns we have. We will add a 1 to a list called
bag if the a tokenized word in patterns also appears in the tokenized, stemmed list of words. If not we add a 0

We also need to format our output to make sense to the network so we create output lists which are the same length
as the amount of tags we have in our dataset. Each position in the list will represent one tag and if we want that tag
then a 1 will be noted for the tag
